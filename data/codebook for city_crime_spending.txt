city_crime_spending_logfix.csv - Codebook
-----------------------------------------

Overview:
This dataset simulates criminology-style city-level data for teaching regression diagnostics. 
It is designed so that the relationship between city population and police spending violates 
linear regression assumptions (nonlinearity and heteroskedasticity), but improves after applying 
a log transformation to police_spending.

Variables:

id
  - Description: Unique identifier for each city
  - Type: Integer
  - Range: 1–500

region
  - Description: U.S. Census region of the city
  - Type: Categorical (Northeast, Midwest, South, West)

population
  - Description: Total population of the city
  - Type: Integer
  - Units: People
  - Range: Approximately 20,000 to 1,000,000

violent_crime_rate
  - Description: Reported violent crime rate per 100,000 residents
  - Type: Numeric
  - Units: Crimes per 100,000 residents
  - Range: Approximately 200–800
  - Notes: Increases mildly with city size with random noise

unemployment_rate
  - Description: Unemployment rate in the city
  - Type: Numeric
  - Units: Percent (%)
  - Range: 3–12

police_spending
  - Description: Annual city spending on police (in millions of dollars)
  - Type: Numeric
  - Units: Millions of USD
  - Range: Roughly 100–900 (varies by simulation)
  - Notes: Positively related to population, with nonlinear and heteroskedastic structure.
    After applying log(police_spending), the model assumptions of linear regression improve.
