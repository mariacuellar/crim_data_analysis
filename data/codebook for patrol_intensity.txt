Conceptual Overview

U-shaped relationship: patrol_intensity → property_crime_rate - Low
patrols = weak deterrence → higher crime - Moderate patrols = strongest
deterrence → lowest crime - Very high patrols = reactive deployment in
already high-crime areas → higher crime again

S-shaped relationship: cctv_density → theft_rate - Low CCTV coverage =
minimal effect - Moderate levels = strong deterrence - High levels =
saturation / plateau due to adaptation

Teaching Notes

Students can: - Fit linear, quadratic, or spline regressions to
visualize nonlinearity. - Examine residuals to detect curvature. -
Interpret patterns in criminological context (reactive policing,
deterrence saturation). - Discuss endogeneity and causal inference
limits when patrols respond to crime levels.
