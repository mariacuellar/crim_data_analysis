### 6. Quantitative EDA (5 points) 

> Describe the centrality and spread of this variable. 

*Notice that if the median and mean are very different from each other, that is one way of telling that the distribution is skewed, if you didn't already know from visual inspection.*

### Extra credit. Visual EDA (5 points)

> Let's explore the low peak for Black individuals in the histogram of bail_amount. Do individuals of a certain race tend to go to a specific type of court, and do those have lower bail amounts? For instance, do Black individuals tend to go to municipal court, and is that where all those super low bail amounts come from? 

To answer this question, you can make a histogram for bail_amount, and then split it up by court_type *and* race (one way to do this is by faceting by court_type~race, and another is by using fill or color).
